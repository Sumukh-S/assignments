1) What do you mean by an Array?
A) An array is a collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays in Java are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

2) How to create an Array?
A) In Java, you create an array by specifying the type of elements and the number of elements it can hold. For example:
   int[] arr = new int[5]; // Creates an array of integers with 5 elements.

3) Can we change the size of an array at runtime?
A) No, the size of an array in Java is fixed when it is created and cannot be changed later. If you need a dynamic size, you can use collections like ArrayList.

4) Can you declare an array without assigning the size of the array?
A) Yes, you can declare an array without specifying the size, but memory must be allocated later. For example:
   int[] arr; // Declares an array.
   arr = new int[5]; // Memory is allocated for 5 integers.

5) What is the default value of an Array?
A) The default values of an array in Java depend on the type of the elements:
   - Numeric types (int, float, double): 0
   - Boolean: false
   - Reference types (e.g., String): null

6) What is a 1D array with an example?
A) A 1D array is a single-dimensional array where elements are stored in a linear form (one row). For example:
   int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // This is a 1D array of integers.

7) Write a program on a 2D array?
A) Here's an example of a 2D array in Java:
   ```java
   public class TwoDArrayExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           int[][] matrix = {
               {1, 2, 3},
               {4, 5, 6},
               {7, 8, 9}
           };

           for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
               for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
                   System.out.print(matrix[i][j] + " ");
               }
               System.out.println();
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   This program creates a 3x3 2D array and prints its elements.
