1. What is the Collection framework in Java
The Collection framework in Java is a set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly used data structures such as lists, sets, queues, and maps. It provides ready-to-use implementations that make handling collections easier and more efficient.

2. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList
ArrayList is implemented using a dynamic array, which makes random access faster but insertions and deletions slower. LinkedList is implemented using a doubly linked list, making insertions and deletions faster but random access slower.

3. What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator
Iterator allows traversing elements in a collection only in the forward direction, while ListIterator allows traversal in both forward and backward directions.

4. What is the difference between Iterator and Enumeration
Iterator allows both read and remove operations, while Enumeration only supports reading elements. Iterator is more modern and preferred over Enumeration.

5. What is the difference between List and Set
List allows duplicate elements and maintains insertion order, whereas Set does not allow duplicates and does not guarantee any specific order.

6. What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet
HashSet is backed by a hash table and does not maintain order, whereas TreeSet is implemented using a balanced tree (Red-Black Tree) and maintains elements in sorted order.

7. What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Array is a fixed-size data structure that stores elements of the same type, while ArrayList is dynamic in size and provides additional utility methods for manipulation.
