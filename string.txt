A String in Java is an immutable sequence of characters stored as a char array, represented by the String class.
What are the types of Strings in Java?

Immutable Strings: String
Mutable Strings: StringBuffer, StringBuilder
In how many ways can you create string objects in Java?

Using string literals: String s = "Hello";
Using new keyword: String s = new String("Hello");
What is a String Constant Pool?

It is a special memory area in the heap where Java stores string literals to avoid redundancy and save memory.
What do you mean by mutable and immutable objects?

Immutable: Cannot be modified after creation (String).
Mutable: Can be modified (StringBuffer, StringBuilder).
Where exactly is the String Constant Pool located in the memory?

It is part of the heap memory but managed separately to store string literals efficiently.
