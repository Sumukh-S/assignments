1. Conditional Operators in Java: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=.

2. Types of operators based on the number of operands: Unary, Binary, Ternary.

3. Switch case in Java programming: Switch case is used for decision making where multiple choices are available.

4. Priority levels of arithmetic operation in Java: (), ++, --, *, /, %, +, -.

5. Conditional Statements in Java: if, if-else, nested if. Conditional statements are used for decision making in Java.

6. Syntax of if else statement in Java: 
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if the condition is false
}

7. 3 types of iterative statements in Java: for, while, do-while.

8. Difference between for loop and do-while loop:
   - for loop: Executes a block of code repeatedly for a fixed number of times.
   - do-while loop: Executes a block of code once, and then repeats the execution as long as a specified condition is true.

9. Program to print numbers from 1 to 10 in Java:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
